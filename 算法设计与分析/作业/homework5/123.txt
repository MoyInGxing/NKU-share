Implement algorithms of optimal caching and give some examples to test it. 
Input:The first line is size of cache k, initial blocks number now in cache and the number s for the sequence of requests. The second line is the initial block now in cache The third line is the block no for the sequence of request. Output: eviction schedule(when some blocks can be considered at the same time, the longest not used one should be evicted first)
Example:
Input:
3 1 10
1
2 4 3 1 5 3 2 1 4 2
Output:
4 1 5 3

Implement Dijkstra algorithms of single-source shortest path and give some
examples to test it. Input: a directed graph with n nodes and e edges, source node�s, the length of each edge (�xi,xj,l�)
Output: the shortest distance of other nodes and corresponding path. Example:
Input:
5 8 1
1 2 2
2 3 2

1 3 5
3 4 3
1 4 4
1 5 7
4 5 2
Output:
0 2 4 3 5
